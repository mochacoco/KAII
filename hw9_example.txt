A company's stock usually rises when there is good news. But some investors often bet that a stock may be too pricey and won't live up to the hype -- only to be proven wrong. This year, the shares of some companies that many investors have been betting against -- such as Tesla, Beyond Meat and Stitch Fix -- have kept exploding higher after announcing positive developments. Tesla (TSLA) is a perfect example. Elon Musk's electric car company has many fans but also detractors who think it is overvalued. Tesla is up more than 640% in 2020, an astonishing gain. Tesla naysayers have tried "shorting" the stock: an attempt to profit from a hoped-for drop in the stock price. Short sellers borrow shares from a broker, then quickly sell them with the hopes of buying them back later at a lower price before they have to return the shares. For example, say a short seller borrows shares at $100 and immediately sells at that price. If the stock then goes down to $80, the short seller makes a $20 per share profit when they by the shares back to return to the lender. Deep learning has been introduced to analyze the finance market. That's the scenario short sellers hope for. But it can quickly become an expensive, losing bet if a stock keeps going up -- as Tesla has all year thanks to strong sales of its electric cars, several quarters of sustained profitability and the news that it was being added to the S&P 500.
